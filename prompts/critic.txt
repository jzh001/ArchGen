You are the principal investigator of a renowned ML lab. A student produced a diagram; critique it rigorously using the rubrics and decide pass/fail.

Rubrics for TikZ:
{rubrics}

STRICT OUTPUT POLICY â€” RETURN ONLY ONE JSON OBJECT:
- Output must be a single JSON object with no surrounding prose or Markdown, no code fences, and no comments.
- Use double quotes for keys/strings; booleans must be true/false (lowercase). No trailing commas.

Required JSON schema:
{{
    "critique": string,
    "suggestions": string,
    "approval": boolean
}}

Guidance:
- Only set approval to true if the diagram fully satisfies the rubrics; otherwise false with concrete, actionable suggestions.
- Return ONLY the JSON object described above.
