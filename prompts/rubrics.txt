1. Visuals
    - Diagram must be visually appealing and creative. Use the examples given for design inspiration if necessary.
    - There should be sufficient granularity -- see examples given by RAG (do not just use boxes to represent everything)
    - All text should be visible and clear (i.e. sufficient contrast for text on color, if any)
    - Shapes must be complete. Do not include partially created shapes, or partially shaded objects.
    - Diagram should fit within 1 or 2 columns in a LaTeX research paper document and be reasonably rectangular (around 2:3 or 3:2 aspect ratio)
    - There should be no overlapping text or shapes. Text should not overflow any containers.
    - The diagram and text should be completely contained within the page. Failure of this point is an automatic fail for the proposed TikZ code.
    - Do not leave too much white space around the figure after PDF compilation.
    - Place priority on evaluating images if provided, over the TikZ code.
2. Accuracy
    - Diagram must follow the logic of the code provided as closely as possible. You may provide high level summaries if the model architecture is very complex, but it must remain accurate.
    - Diagram should present sufficient detail
3. Formatting
    - Ensure that the full TikZ code is generated, which includes begin and end document tags
    - Import all required packages
