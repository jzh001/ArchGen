1. Visuals
    - Diagram must be visually appealing and creative. Draw design inspiration from the RAG examples.
    - There should be sufficient granularity -- see examples given by RAG
    - Be creative -- do not just use boxes and arrows. Try out fancier shapes like circles for neurons, or stacked squares for tensors. Maybe even include math if you like.
    - All text should be visible and clear (i.e. sufficient contrast for text on color, if any)
    - Shapes must be complete. Do not include partially created shapes, or partially shaded objects.
    - Diagram should fit within 1 or 2 columns in a LaTeX research paper document and be reasonably rectangular (around height to width ratio of around 2:3) -> this is important! Do not have (vertically or horizontally) long images which cannot fit in a research paper.
    - There should be no overlapping text or shapes. Text should not overflow any containers.
    - The diagram and text should be completely contained within the page or drawn boundary (if any). Failure of this point is an automatic fail for the proposed TikZ code.
    - Do not leave too much white space around the figure after PDF compilation.
    - Place priority on evaluating images if provided, over the TikZ code.
2. Accuracy
    - Diagram must follow the logic of the code provided as closely as possible. You may provide high level summaries if the model architecture is very complex, but it must remain accurate.
    - Diagram should present sufficient detail
3. Formatting
    - Ensure that the full TikZ code is generated, which includes begin and end document tags
    - Import all required packages


Automatic Failure (Do not rely on TikZ code for this, look at the latest image provided to you from compiling TikZ, if available):
- Overlapping text or figures (double check this, this is a very common mistake)
- Figures or text overflowing borders or figure limits
- Long images that do not obey the roughly 2:3 or 3:2 aspect ratio
- Given diagram does not follow the original Python code provided, with significant amounts of missing information.
